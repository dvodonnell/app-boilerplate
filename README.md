===============

A CodeIgniter+Backbone PHP/JS Boilerplate for quickly starting an 'API'-heavy web app

## Libraries Used

This boilerplate makes use of:

* CodeIgniter
* BackboneJS
* UnderscoreJS
* jQuery
* RequireJS

Obviously there is a lot of personal preference there, but I'd like to think these choices share a
common thread in their minimal use of 'magic' and the option of using as much or as little of them as you like.
